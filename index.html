            <p id="web-security-answer">First of, I would suggest either educating themselves or hiring someone with good knowledge on the topics of security, threats, best practices and so forth.
                Secondly, with that in mind, I would ask them to apply a SecDecOps approach, preferably one that is backed by set guidelines and tools, such as SaC or IaC.
        These two things should help keep things nice and tidy on their end, thus minimizing the chances of breaches.
        
        Furthermore, I would push them to use a form of two factor authorisation, be it an established one like Google Authenticator, a propitiatory one or a simple code/verification to email or phone. 
        This in combination with a good password requirement strategy should help keep things safer on the client side.
        
        In between these two, a focus on keeping only necessary data on the site, omitting things like full payment information, personal information and so on.
        One way of doing this is making sure they use the options already out there, things like Visa Secure, Vipps and other payment platforms. 
        Likewise, allowing accounts from large providers such as Google, Microsoft, Apple and so on, implementing their authentications, password protection and recovery, at least as a backup, should help clients to keep information safer.
        
        But nothing is completely safe, even these big hitters gets hit and their measures fail.
        So my final advice would be to keep stay in the know and  keep updating, improving and testing.
